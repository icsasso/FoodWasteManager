# &hacks Project - Food Waste Manager App
Created by: Isabella Sasso, Claudia Cordero-Ramos, Alan Gonzalez Osorio, Matteo Radcliffe

## Inspiration
Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted simply because people forget what they bought or when it expires. Our Android app, Food Waste Manager, tackles this issue by giving users a simple way to track and manage their food items. Users can quickly add or edit their groceries, view an organized food list, and also get recipe inspiration. By helping households waste less, the app not only saves money but also reduces environmental impact.

## What it does
Food Waste Manager is an Android app designed to help users combat food waste by keeping track of their groceries and expiration dates. Users can add and edit their food inventory, view a list of items, and stay aware of when food is about to expire. The app encourages sustainable habits and smarter food management by also recommending recipes for their food items.

## How we built it
We first planned out our idea and made some visualizations of the app's frontend (using Canva and drawing by hand), and then we all went into Android Studio to begin our journey :)

## API Choice
We chose to work with TheMealDB API for the recipes part of our project.

## Challenges we ran into
Merge requests...

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Most of us worked with Kotlin for the first time and also learned more about connecting backend code to frontend code!

## What we learned
We learned a lot of new Kotlin skills, teamwork-ing with Git, and how to work with a database

## What's next for Food Waste Manager
We would want to try adding a “food sharing” feature for local communities, hopefully minimizing food waste even more
